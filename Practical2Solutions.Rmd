## Aim:
To compare
This study compared infant gaze a
"First, the infant viewed side-by-side high-definition video recordings of the two unfamiliar individuals, smiling with direct gaze at the infant, for 16 s (baseline trial). Then, the infant viewed, in turn, one 22-s video of each of the two individuals singing one of the two songs while continuing to look and smile at the infant. 
Finally, the infant viewed a silent 16-s test trial that was identical to the baseline trial. A looming object with an attractive sound effect brought the infantâ€™s eyes to the center of the screen before the baseline and test trials"

"At test, however, the infants selectively attended to the now-silent singer of the song with the familiar melody; the proportion of time during which they looked toward ... greater than the proportion at baseline
(difference in proportion of looking: M = .072, SD = .169,
95% CI = [.011, .133]), t(31) = 2.42, p = .022, d = 0.43" (p4 in.pdf version)

This practical will use proportion of gaze timebaseline data with final condition of the silent 16-s test.

IV: Proportion of Gaze Time
DV: Baseline (Control), Experimental Condition (Silent Singers)
The aims of this practical are as follows:

- 0 Read in the Data File
- 1 Summarise Data by group|total Means and StDec in particular
- 2 Visualise Data by group|total Histograms and a boxplot
- 3 Perform a REPEATED MEASURES t-test using the `t.test()` function
- 4 Calculate the appropriate effect size measure with the `effsize` package
- 5 Calculate the POST-HOC Power with the `pwr` package

You may looad and use the following packages:
`psych`, `summarytools`,`pwr` and `effsize`
Make liberal use of the helper function, either through pressing F1 during autocomplete, or using`?t.test` or any other function.
You can also compile this into a rendered HTMLbook by clicking the preview button on the task bar above this script.

#Practical

##0 Read the data file `"Practical2Data.csv"` into an object names p2d, then print out the dataframe
```{r}
p2d  <-  read.csv("Practical2Data.csv")
p2d
```

##1 Summarise data 
```{r}
by(p2d,                                      # Tell R where the data is
   p2d$Condition,                            # Tell R what/where the category is
   descr)
```

##2 Visualise Data
```{r}
#pdf("Session2Materials/PlotsS2/S2_Practical_Panel_Plot.pdf")
# This sets the image parameters, 2 rows, 2 columns
par(mfrow=c(2,2))                               

# Histogram of All responses
hist(p2d$Proportion,                            # Select variable
     main="Histogram : All Gaze Proportions",   # Set main title
     xlab="Gaze Proportion",                    # Set x axis title
     col = "white",                             # Set Colour
     border = "black"                           # Set bar edge colour
)

# Box plot comparing responses
boxplot(formula = Proportion ~ Condition,          # Select Y and X variables
        data = p2d,                                # Tell R to use this data 
        main = "Boxplot : Condition x Proportion", # Set the main title
        col = c("tomato", "dodgerblue2"))          # Set colours

# Histogram of Male responses
hist(p2d$Proportion[p2d$Condition=="Baseline"],   # Select variable
     main="Histogram : Baseline Proportion",      # Set main title
     xlab="Gaze Proportion",                      # Set x axis title
     col = "tomato",                              # Set Colour
     border = "white"                             # Set bar edge colour
)
     
# Histogram of Female Responses
hist(p2d$Proportion[p2d$Condition=="Experimental"],   # Select variable
     main="Histogram : Experimental Proportion",      # Set main title
     xlab="Gaze Proportion",                          # Set x axis title
     col = "dodgerblue2",                             # Set Colour
     border = "white"                                 # Set bar edge colour
)

par(mfrow=c(1,1))                                 # This returns the image parameters to normal
#dev.off()                                        # This closes the graphics device for saving

```

##3 Perform F test
```{r}
var.test(Proportion ~ Condition, data = p2d)
```

##4 Normality
use the Shapiro-Wilks test for the Baseline condition
```{r}
shapiro.test(p2d$Proportion[p2d$Condition=="Baseline"])
```


Use the Shapiro-Wilks test for the Experimental condition
```{r}
shapiro.test(p2d$Proportion[p2d$Condition=="Experimental"])
```


comment on the distributions and histograms:



note if the variances are equal
##4 Perform a shapiro wilks test
# Repeated samples t.test
inside the t.test function you will have to use the `paired=TRUE` argument for the t test to run 
```{r}
t.test(Proportion ~ Condition, data = p2d, paired=TRUE)
```

## Effect size
Now Calulate the effect size using the `effsize` package
```{r}
library(effsize)
effsize::cohen.d.formula(Proportion ~ Condition, data = p2d)

```

## Post-hoc Power
```{r}
library(pwr)
pwr.t.test(n=32, d = -.4, sig=.05, type = "paired")
```
