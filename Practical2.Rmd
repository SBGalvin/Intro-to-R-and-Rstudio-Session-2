## Aim:
To compare
This study compared infant gaze a
"First, the infant viewed side-by-side high-definition video recordings of the two unfamiliar individuals, smiling with direct gaze at the infant, for 16 s (baseline trial). Then, the infant viewed, in turn, one 22-s video of each of the two individuals singing one of the two songs while continuing to look and smile at the infant. 
Finally, the infant viewed a silent 16-s test trial that was identical to the baseline trial. A looming object with an attractive sound effect brought the infantâ€™s eyes to the center of the screen before the baseline and test trials"

"At test, however, the infants selectively attended to the now-silent singer of the song with the familiar melody; the proportion of time during which they looked toward ... greater than the proportion at baseline
(difference in proportion of looking: M = .072, SD = .169,
95% CI = [.011, .133]), t(31) = 2.42, p = .022, d = 0.43" (p4 in.pdf version)

This practical will use proportion of gaze timebaseline data with final condition of the silent 16-s test.

IV: Proportion of Gaze Time
DV: Baseline (Control), Experimental Condition (Silent Singers)
The aims of this practical are as follows:

- 0 Read in the Data File
- 1 Summarise Data by group|total Means and StDec in particular
- 2 Visualise Data by group|total Histograms and a boxplot
- 3 Perform a REPEATED MEASURES t-test using the `t.test()` function
- 4 Calculate the appropriate effect size measure with the `effsize` package
- 5 Calculate the POST-HOC Power with the `pwr` package

You may looad and use the following packages:
`psych`, `summarytools`,`pwr` and `effsize`
Make liberal use of the helper function, either through pressing F1 during autocomplete, or using`?t.test` or any other function.
You can also compile this into a rendered HTMLbook by clicking the preview button on the task bar above this script.

#Practical

##0 Read the data file `"Practical2Data.csv"` into an object names p2d, then print out the dataframe
```{r}
```

##1 Summarise data 
```{r}
```

Note the Means and Standard Deviations for each group and the total

##2 Visualise Data
```{r}
```

comment on the distributions and histograms:


##3 Perform F test
```{r}
```
Note if the variances are equal


##4 Normality

Use the Shapiro-Wilks test for all the Proportion data
```{r}

```


use the Shapiro-Wilks test on the Proportion data for the Baseline condition
```{r}
```


Use the Shapiro-Wilks test on the Proportion data for the Experimental condition
```{r}
```


# Repeated samples t.test

inside the t.test function you will have to use the `paired=TRUE` argument for the t test to run 
```{r}
```

## Effect size
Now Calulate the effect size using the `effsize` package
```{r}
```

## Post-hoc Power
```{r}
```
